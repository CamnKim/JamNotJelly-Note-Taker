you'll need to pip install unnittest and behave and pytest (optionally)
these tests assume that your computer has the chromedriver installed and knows where its at
(add to system path variables)
if you get an error about it you might need to enter you path to chromdriver manually in the test



To run all unittests(behaivoral) go to test directory and write in cmd line
"python unittest -m "
to run a specific test do
"python unittest test.py"
or you could also do 
python test.py

you can also download pytest and run all the python tests using the cmd "pytest" in the test directory




behave tests have a scenario written in semi natural language and steps which 
implement those scenarios with code

To run all behave tests(also behaivoral)
got to features directory and use the cmd "behave"
to run a aspecific test write behave + steps test file name
"behave loginsteps"
you might need to make that "loginsteps.py"



We have 1 non behaivoral test that tests password hashing that can be found in the
mysite directory and its called test2.py
we have not really done much backend testing
Technically as people write new features they should be writing their own 
unit tests for those features (aka TDD)
going backward and doing it feels like a waste of time but if 
you think of general important test we could put into our 
continuous integration/pull request tests please tell us and we'll write them
